You've heard the saying: "There is always someone who's better than you." Better at sports. Better at art. Better at writing. Better at your job. Better at whatever you can think of. Better at **life**. The curious thing is that there is usually an implied meaning of "Therefore don't stress yourself out," which I always found puzzling. Because, to me, this statement simultaneously serves as an encouragement and also gives me a feeling of inadequacy. Because those people that are better than me are better than me *for a reason*. Some of these reasons are largely out of my control (intelligence, talent, country of birth, access to education) while others are very much in my control (time spent working in that domain, amount of self-reflection, asking the right people). So, if I maximized the things that are in my control, I could likely elevate my position in that domain.

Still, even then, there are most likely going to be people above me. The ones with better non-controllable stats, so to speak. The ones with a super high IQ, whose parents directed their education into this domain from a very young age, who had access to the state-of-the-art both in terms of education and tools. You can believe in yourself as much as you want, but you will never outperform these people. Zero chance. So don't even try. This is the part of the above-mentioned implicit conclusion I agree with. And it can set you free, if you remind yourself of that. But it's easy to fool yourself into thinking somebody is better than you because of their upbringing, when it was actually their hard work, and you are just being lazy (in comparison).

I think the best approach is to appreciated the people above you -- those that you know you cannot possibly surpass -- as much as possible, and be inspired by them. But if you do this with someone you actually believe might be on the same level as you, you'll notice and lose your drive because you're being dishonest with yourself. You know that you actually *could* surpass them if you just tried a little harder. And by not trying, you're putting an end to your personal development. Because a refusal to try is an acceptance of the fact that you are incapable of becoming any better than you are now. Your body and mind will tell you if you've reached a wrong conclusion --- by becoming depressed and lethargic.
