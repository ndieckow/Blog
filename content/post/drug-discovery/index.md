This post will be the result of some high-level research on the current state of automated drug discovery.

In particular, I want to be able to formulate "the drug discovery" problem as a search problem. Not sure if that's possible, but why not? In the end, I would like to discuss the (in)applicability of current methods of traversing huge state spaces (think AlphaZero) and what current researchers are working on.

## 1. What is a Drug?
> Probably just a chemical compound. Or multiple?

## 2. Traversing the Drug Space
> It's huge

## 3. Connections to Automated Theorem Proving
> I mean, why not? Both are search problems in huge search spaces. In both areas, breakthroughs have been achieved by aggressively searching/trying, or by accident. The nature of these two problems is essentially the same.
