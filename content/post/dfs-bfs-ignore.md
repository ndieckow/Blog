When trying to familiarize myself with a new field, I often find myself overwhelmed by the possible avenues to take. I can read papers, lots of papers. But I could also try working through a tutorial. And hey, there's a Twitter post talking about something that's tagentially relevant to the field. Or maybe I should just read a textbook. But that textbook contains lots of references to landmark papers, so maybe I should read them. At the end, I'm exhausted without having actually advanced in the field. This is a problem.

When researching a new topic, there are in principle two strategies: depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS). If you are familiar with graph theory, you'll understand right away what I mean. Let's say, you're reading an article about this topic, and within the article there is a link to a related concept that sounds relevant to you. Do you click on it and read it right away (DFS)? Or do you open it in a new tab with the intention of reading it later (BFS)?

In my opinion, both strategies are bad when used exclusively, but BFS is a bit better. The DFS strategy will never allow you to finish an article and thus prevent you from ever getting the satisfying feeling of "yes, I got that concept down". On the other hand, the BFS strategy quickly becomes overwhelming, because you will inevitably see the number of opened tabs increase uncontrollably. Everybody is different, but for me, each open tab and browser window is an additional source of stress. I try to keep the number of opened browser tabs to a minimum.

So what's the solution? I suggest limited DFS/BFS. In the case of DFS, don't go further than a depth of, say, 3. With BFS, you can set the limit a bit higher, maybe 5 opened tabs in the background. In any case, once you've hit the limit, you should strive to complete reading or working through whatever resource you've got in front of you. Otherwise, you will go crazy, trust me. In particular, be extremely liberal with ignoring irrelevant information. It is compelling to try and suck up every little piece of knowledge you can get your hands on, but especially in the beginning it is wise to restrict yourself to very, very few resources covering the basics. So, the main takeaway is this: if you are reading a good resource and there is a shiny, blue link to another website or a paper reference, ignore it. It's for your own good. And if it's important, it's very likely you'll stumble across it again in the future anyway.
