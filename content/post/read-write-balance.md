The balance between reading and writing is a difficult one to manage. On the one hand, reading, especially reading **a lot**, is extremely beneficial for your general understanding of the field, including the most recent developments. On the other hand, while reading other people's work can be inspiring and illuminating, it also tends to shut down your own creativity. You will be unable to produce any real ideas of your own, because you're just used to parsing and understanding what other people have done. That creative part of the brain then just kinda turns off.

I propose consumption and production phases. Maybe one or two weeks each. In these phases, about 80% of your work is focused on either consumption (reading what other people have done) or production (producing/developing your own ideas and models). You can still do active research in a consumption phase, and you can still read in a production phase. But the time allocated to these tasks should be held to a minimum, and I even think you should avoid reading the most recent papers in your field altogether when you're in a production phase. Because it will just give you performance anxiety, impostor syndrome, or some other shit you really don't need at the moment.
