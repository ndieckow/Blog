Idea: About reading one article, finding several links in there and opening them, immediately reading those, finding more links in there, etc. Eventually you have 100 tabs open and feel overwhelmed. Essentially an essay about BFS vs. DFS when doing literature research / learning about a new topic, and the advice of not going beyond a certain depth, in case of the latter. Or, best, just using BFS.

Your field of research is an expanding graph. As long as you are not slower than its expansion, you will read all papers, given enough time, regardless of your strategy. To measure its expansion, just look at how many papers are published each week on average. That's how many you should read per week. And if that's impossible, maybe your field of research is too broad ;)

This has a broader impact: Keeping your exploration depth low, keeps your stress low. At least, this is something I have observed in myself. I wonder if there are some empirical studied on this. In this case, BFS doesn't get away with it either: Keeping my tab (and window) count low reduces my stress and proclivity to distraction as well. This is because each new tab or each new tangent requires a small amount of "memory" in your brain that basically stores the previous state/context.

(Damn, listening to Andrej Karpathy before doing something makes me 10x smarter)
