It is often said that the best way to learn something is by teaching it to others. Indeed, I have always found that concepts only start clicking once I explain them to someone, or write a blog post about it. Probably because I thereby prove to myself that I am able to linearly go through the entire concept from start to finish in my head. I believe that a large part of understanding is not individual concepts/techniques/etc., but the links between them as well as the confidence of knowing precisely what those links are.

Still, I wonder: Is the teaching material that results as a byproduct of this "learning by teaching" process really useful? After all, the student would be better off trying to teach that concept herself rather than understand **my** product, which is shaped by my understanding, my prior experience, and my questions.

I actually believe that the usefulness of all the blog posts and YouTube videos and Juypter notebooks is quite limited. I also believe that there *is* such a thing as good teaching (and good teaching materials), but it is exceedingly rare. I can count on one hand the number of professors at my university that I honestly think were great teachers. This does not mean that the others didn't have good teaching materials or didn't understand the concepts well. Not at all. But part of being a great teacher is possessing the ability to break concepts down to their essence in a way that almost anybody can understand. Teaching should always be accessible, not elitist. (To be fair, this is easier to do for some subjects - say, linear algebra - than for others - say, quantum mechanics.) I prefer a teacher who can give me an idea and feel of a concept without writing a single formula over a teacher who uses all of the correct notation and has the most pristine slides, but is unable to transmit any intuition.

My point is: For any YouTube video or blog article on some topic you find: **It probably served the creator much more than it will serve you.**

<!-- Where am I going with this? ^^' -->

Am I now saying to please avoid this and not publish any more articles that arised as part of your own learning process? No. I would be a hypocrite, if I said that. This was just something I noticed and wanted to put into words. I suppose, a less criticizing way to look at it is in terms of a cycle. The learning cycle almost always starts by reading someone else's work. Sure, they may have gotten more value out of writing that particular piece than you will reading it, but you will also read many others. The knowledge will accumulate and eventually you'll be able to publish your own article or YouTube video. Now **you're** on the other end of the stick :) A downside to this is an over-abundance of mediocre teaching material available online.
