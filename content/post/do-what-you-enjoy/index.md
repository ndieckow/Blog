I'm sure you've heard the following at least once in your life:

> "Do what you enjoy."

This piece of advice is so simple and you hear it all the time, and that's because it is so important. I learned this lesson the hard way during my pursuit of a Master's degree. For a bit of background, I did a Bachelor's in Computer Science, but switched to Industrial Mathematics (i.e. Applied Mathematics) for my Master's. The reason I gave to myself and others was because computer science had ignited my interest in mathematics, so I wanted to pursue it. This wasn't entirely wrong. But the real reason was that I found more like-minded people there, and it had fewer course requirements. So far, so good. The real trouble began when I was starting to near the end of my studies. It was time to look for a topic for a Master's thesis and at the time, I had no clue what to do. I wrote about reinforcement learning in my Bachelor's thesis, but I had learned so many new things in my Master's (from so many different fields), it was hard to pick a topic.

As I am a comfortable person, I was just waiting for an opportunity for someone to make that decision for me. And luckily for me, it came. A chief engineer from my old university contacted me and asked when I would be done with my Master's and whether I was interested in a certain PhD position in machine learning. I was ecstatic at the word "PhD". Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought of myself pursuing a PhD -- but now there is an offer for me? Hastily, I expressed interest and also asked him whether he could supervise a Master's thesis in machine learning. He said yes. Great, right?

Unfortunately, I had a tendency at the time to think that these synchronicities (i.e. things that just come to you in the perfect moment) were literally perfect in every way, causing me to not question them. For example, I had no idea what the PhD position would be about -- sure, machine learning, but it's a broad field. It turned out to be something related to material science, and I couldn't even tell you what exactly, because I cared so little about it. Still, my Master's thesis was already on the way in a similar field. I made sure to keep it mathematical, but still some physics (fluid mechanics, to be precise) slipped into it. "Sure, why not, it'll be a great challenge," I told myself, who dropped physics in 10th grade.

...

It's 6 months later now, and I am almost finished with my thesis. It was indeed a great challenge and I suppose I surmounted it, but was it worth it? Sure, I learned new and valuable things, but I didn't enjoy it. It was a frustrating time and it sometimes messed with my sense of self-worth. On the upside, I feel more resilient and able to push through, even when I don't enjoy my work or don't see the point. I guess this quality can come in handy at times. Still, my advice to everyone would be to do what you enjoy, instead of what you dread but think might be a good challenge. Ideally, it'll be a good challenge **and** you'll enjoy it.

Now, how does the story end? I turned down the PhD position, and I am very glad I did so. I also learned that PhD positions are not as rare as I thought at the start of the year, and I managed to secure myself a different PhD position in machine learning -- which, notably, does not involve physics that I don't care about. My future blog posts will go into more detail once I start next year.
